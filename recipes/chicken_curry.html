    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs (about 700g) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to absorb.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add finely chopped onions and cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add coriander powder and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, cover the pan, and let the chicken cook for another 15-20 minutes until it's tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Add garam masala and adjust salt and spice levels according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves. Serve hot with rice or bread of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
