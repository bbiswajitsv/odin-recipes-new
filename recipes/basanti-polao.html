    <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>
    <p class="description">
        <strong>Basanti polao</strong> or mishti polao is a sweet, ghee-laden rice dish made from fragrant gobindabhog
        or kalijeera rice, cashew nuts and raisins. This is the main rice dish of choice for any special occasion. 
    </p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>500 g aged gobindobhog rice</li>
        <li>100 g bengali-style ghee</li>
        <li>6 g ginger (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>8 pcs cardamom</li>
        <li>3 pcs cinnamon</li>
        <li>8 pcs cloves</li>
        <li>3 pcs bay leaves</li>
        <li>20 g salt</li>
        <li>70 g sugar</li>
        <li>35 g cashew nuts</li>
        <li>35 g raisins</li>
        <li>6 pcs green chillies</li>
        <li>1050 g hot water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Wash and rinse rice, and leave it to air-dry over a strainer.</li>
        <li>Once dry, transfer it to a mixing bowl. Add to it finely chopped ginger, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, and Bengali-style ghee. Mix until rice grains are well coated with ghee and spices. Cover and rest for about an hour.</li>
        <li>Before you start cooking, set water to boil in a pot or in an electric kettle.</li>
        <li>Heat 5 g ghee in a kadai. Add the cashews and fry them until they are lightly coloured (about a minute). Now add the marinated rice. Fry it for about 6 minutes on medium until the rice takes on an opaque appearance. Add the raisins and fry for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add about 1050 g (±5%) hot water, along with the salt. The amount of water is important. Add too much and polao will become soggy, add too little and it may stick to the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on lowest possible heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and slit green chillies. Gently fold them into the rice, taking care to ensure that you don't break the grains of rice too much.</li>
        <li>Put the lid back on and steam for another 5 mins to let the sugar dissolve and any remaining moisture get absorbed into the rice. Turn off the heat and let it rest for some time before serving.</li>
    </ol>
